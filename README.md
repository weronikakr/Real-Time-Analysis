# Real-Time Heart Rate Analysis Project

This project involves the real-time monitoring and analysis of a patient's heart rate using Apache Kafka. The system continuously ingests heart rate data, processes it to detect anomalies, and generates warnings if any irregularities are detected. This solution is designed to provide timely alerts for potential health issues, enabling prompt medical attention.
